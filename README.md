# MassWhisper
This [Roll20](http://roll20.net/) script allows the GM to send a whisper to multiple characters at once. Just select a token for every character to whom you wish to whisper, then send your message after the `!whisper` command. It's that simple!

##Example

`!whisper You feel a slight breeze coming from the doorway to your left...`
